# Spider-Open-Source-Silicon-Foundation
Collection of installation and Tutorials on using open-source tools in VLSI domain. Baby steps in democratizing IC design and research for one and all.

## Motive
EDA Major Players
* majorplayer1  : U.S. pricing for a one-year license starts at **$140,000** -- **$100,000** -- **$15,000** 
* majorplayer2 : A one-year license for Certify costs **$45,000**, and a perpetual license costs **$115,000**. pricing for Design Compiler FPGA starts at **$29,000**
* majorplayer3 : integrated IC tool suite costs about **$25,000**

Roughly 10000 $ --> 7,50,000 â‚¹ 

```
EDA tools are very expensive, essential to R&D work
```

```
The dilemma facing EDA vendors is that a high price puts the tool out of reach of the small- and medium-sized R&D companies, severely limiting the market, but a low price may not generate enough volume to pay the bills. 
```
Our Aim is to develop an open-source Ecosystem in VLSI where anyone can undertake research projects using existing and new open-source tools. installation and usage of such open source tools are quite tricky and this is an attempt at developing a community of support ,guidance and quality Research work using the tools.
